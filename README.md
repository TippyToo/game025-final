## Game World

## Game Experience

[GAME TITLE] is a 2D side-scrolling platformer and Metroidvania, broken up into two distinct levels, with character progression based primarily in the acquisition of various power-ups and abilities to clear and overcome obstacles.

### Level 1
The player must navigate through the vast and wild expanses of the Wasteland, initially strapped with only a rusty pipe.
- Traverse harsh terrain, including rusted pipes, pools of acidic/radioactive goop, and high cliffs and pitfalls.  

- Fight off two different types of enemies, each with their own strengths and vulnerabilities. Player is forced to consider the best method of attack in order to survive.  

- Collect [CURRENCY] to exchange at the wayward shop, [SHOP NAME], for better weapons and boosts.  

- Player must unlock various abilities and power-ups to progress.

### Level 2
The player character has now reached the remnants of the destroyed city, [CITY NAME], and must face the growing threat waiting at its center.

- Final boss is located at the end of the level and must be defeated to beat the game. Boss has multiple attacks, forcing player to quickly switch between weapons and use various abilities to take it down.  

- Cityscape is less open, requiring expert maneuvering to make it across obstacles and enemies. 

- Lesser enemies become more frequent until the player reaches the boss.

## Game Mechanics

[GAME TITLE] is played in a third-person scrolling view centered on the 2D player character. The player character must run, jump, bash, and shoot their way across the game world. Players can use a variety of basic movements, such as run and jump, but will also gain access to two advanced movements as the game progresses: double jump and dash.

### Movement Mechanics

#### Double Jump

After acquiring the double jump power-up, player characters will be able to jump once more in the air after their regular jump.

#### Dash

After acquiring the dash power-up, player characters will be able to dash for a short amount of time while moving. This move is most useful when paired with the jump and double jump features, creating the dash jump, which allows the player to dash across the screen mid-jump.

### Weapon Mechanics

Beyond these basic and advanced movements, players will also use various weapons throughout the game, which are broken down into either melee type or ranged type.

#### Melee

The player begins with a rusted metal pipe. With a short attack range and slower attack speed (compared to the ranged weapon), the melee weapon makes up for its weaknesses with a decisively higher attack power. Best used in short-range and against enemies too strong/fast to take out with just the ranged attack. Better melee weapons become available as the player progresses.

#### Ranged

The player acquires a pistol early on in level one, unlocking the ranged attack. As their name suggests, ranged weapons have increased range, allowing the player to attack from a considerable distance away. However, as a trade-off, early ranged weapons are weaker in comparison to melee weapon attacks. It is best used against armored enemies, allowing the player to damage enemies that are otherwise impervious to short-range melee attacks. Better ranged weapons become available as the player progresses.

### Currency Mechanics

To acquire weapons upgrades as well as various boosts to health, the character must collect [CURRENCY], the main currency of the Wasteland. These tokens can then be exchanged at the [SHOP NAME], a traveling shop that sells weapons and med packs to roaming explorers such as the player character.

### Health Mechanics

The player characterâ€™s health, located in the corner of the screen and indicated by a number of hearts, lowers when damaged by enemies and obstacles and does not replenish on its own. Should the player character run out of health, the player character dies and the player loses the games, prompting a losing screen. Health can be replenished through the med packs bought from the shop.
