## Game Story

[PLAYER CHARACTER], a wandering scavenger, has found themselves in the middle of the Wasteland without any fuel or means of transportation. Traveling through the harsh environment would surely prove fatal on foot, especially as the dangerous mutants skulk closer. Armed with just a rusty pipe, [PLAYER CHARACTER] must find a way through the wasteland and into the city, where their only shot at survival lies, at the center of a hotbed of ravenous creatures and deadly obstacles. 

## Gameplay

In [GAME TITLE], the player is [PLAYER CHARACTER] traversing perilous post-nuclear fallout in the hopes of finding the proper resources to gain safe passage across the ruined lands. The game is divided into two levels, one centered around the wasteland and the other centered around the city. Stranded in the midst of the arid wastes, players must make their way to the city, where vital resources lie. Beginning with a rusty pipe, the player will first have to make their way across the wasteland, fighting/avoiding mutant enemies and jumping over dangerous pitfalls and radioactive pools to gather different power-ups and weapon upgrades ahead of entering the dangerous city ruins. Once in the city, players will have their mastery of their newfound abilities put to the test as greater amounts of enemies and more difficult terrain make traversing the city risky.

## Game World

The overworld is split into two primary locations: the arid wasteland in level one and the desolate ruins of [CITY NAME] in level two. Taking inspiration from the Fallout series and other sci-fi and post-apocalyptic media, the world feels rather empty and unpredictable, dangers possibly lurking at every corner.

Littered with tall cliffs, endless pits, rusted spike traps, and wild mutant creatures, the wasteland holds true to its name. The remains of the city reach all the way out in the wastes too, evidenced by the rusted pipes that populate the area, which drip the radioactive goop that fills the bright green pools. The wasteland is pretty sparsely populated by humans, who have largely disappeared from the Earth minus the small groups of survivors and scavengers that traverse the land. Some of these survivors have taken to collecting and trading their wares wherever they go, and one such trader has recently set up shop in the wasteland outside of [CITY NAME].

A far cry from its pre-fallout appearance, the city is now mostly rubble and ruins of destroyed buildings and cracked streets. Nowadays, as a result of a scattered human population, the city has become infested with mutant creatures, migrating in from the harsh wasteland. The dark and winding paths through the city have become hotbeds for mutant attacks, leading travelers to avoid the city as much as they can. Nonetheless, the surplus of resources left behind in abandoned supermarkets and apartment homes also make the city a treasure trove, if only one is brave enough to face the life-threatening dangers that lurk within.


## Game Experience

[GAME TITLE] is a 2D side-scrolling platformer and Metroidvania, broken up into two distinct levels, with character progression based primarily in the acquisition of various power-ups and abilities to clear and overcome obstacles.

### Level 1
The player must navigate through the vast and wild expanses of the Wasteland, initially strapped with only a rusty pipe.
- Traverse harsh terrain, including rusted pipes, pools of acidic/radioactive goop, and high cliffs and pitfalls.  

- Fight off two different types of enemies, each with their own strengths and vulnerabilities. Player is forced to consider the best method of attack in order to survive.  

- Collect coins to exchange at the wayward shop, [SHOP NAME], for better weapons and boosts at the start of level 2.

    - Shop will contain upgrades for both weapons, designed to be able to afford one upon first reaching the shop, can come back with enough for the second later.

- Player must unlock various abilities and power-ups to progress.

### Level 2
The player character has now reached the remnants of the destroyed city, [CITY NAME], and must face the growing threat waiting at its center.

- Final boss is located at the end of the level and must be defeated to beat the game. Boss has multiple attacks, forcing player to quickly switch between weapons and use various abilities to take it down.  

- Cityscape is less open, requiring expert maneuvering to make it across obstacles and enemies. 

- Lesser enemies become more frequent until the player reaches the boss.

## Game Mechanics

[GAME TITLE] is played in a third-person scrolling view centered on the 2D player character. The player character must run, jump, bash, and shoot their way across the game world. Players can use a variety of basic movements, such as run and jump, but will also gain access to two advanced movements as the game progresses: double jump and dash.

### Movement Mechanics

#### Double Jump

After acquiring the double jump power-up, player characters will be able to jump once more in the air after their regular jump.

#### Dash

After acquiring the dash power-up, player characters will be able to dash for a short amount of time while moving. This move is most useful when paired with the jump and double jump features, creating the dash jump, which allows the player to dash across the screen mid-jump.

### Weapon Mechanics

Beyond these basic and advanced movements, players will also use various weapons throughout the game, which are broken down into either melee type or ranged type.

#### Melee

The player begins with a rusted metal pipe. With a short attack range and slower attack speed (compared to the ranged weapon), the melee weapon makes up for its weaknesses with a decisively higher attack power. Best used in short-range and against enemies too strong/fast to take out with just the ranged attack. Better melee weapons become available as the player progresses.

#### Ranged

The player acquires a pistol early on in level one, unlocking the ranged attack. As their name suggests, ranged weapons have increased range, allowing the player to attack from a considerable distance away. However, as a trade-off, early ranged weapons are weaker in comparison to melee weapon attacks. It is best used against armored enemies, allowing the player to damage enemies that are otherwise impervious to short-range melee attacks. Better ranged weapons become available as the player progresses.

### Currency Mechanics

To acquire weapons upgrades as well as various boosts to health, the character must collect coins, the main currency of the Wasteland. These tokens can then be exchanged at the [SHOP NAME], a traveling shop that sells weapons and med packs to roaming explorers such as the player character.

### Health Mechanics

The player characterâ€™s health, located in the corner of the screen and indicated by a number of hearts, lowers when damaged by enemies and obstacles and does not replenish on its own. Should the player character run out of health, the player character dies and the player loses the games, prompting a losing screen. Health can be replenished through the med packs bought from the shop.
