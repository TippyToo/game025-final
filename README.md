## Game Story

A wandering scavenger has found themselves in the middle of the Wasteland without any fuel or means of transportation. Traveling through the harsh environment would surely prove fatal on foot, especially as the dangerous mutants skulk closer. Armed with just a rusty pipe, the scavenger must find a way through the wasteland and into the city, where their only shot at survival lies, at the center of a hotbed of ravenous creatures and deadly obstacles. 

## Gameplay

In Pyrite Ruins, the scavenger traverses perilous post-nuclear fallout in the hopes of finding the proper resources to gain safe passage across the ruined lands. The game is divided into two levels, one centered around the wasteland and the other centered around the city. Stranded in the midst of the arid wastes, players must make their way to the city, where vital resources lie. Beginning with a rusty pipe, the player will first have to make their way across the wasteland, fighting/avoiding mutant enemies and jumping over dangerous spike traps and radioactive pools to gather different power-ups and weapon upgrades ahead of entering the dangerous city ruins. Once in the city, players will have their mastery of their newfound abilities put to the test as greater amounts of enemies and more difficult terrain make traversing the city risky. 

## Player Character

The scavenger is a regular human, a survivor of the nuclear fallout that decimated the world years before. They wear a gas mask and a long hooded cloak, protecting themselves from the harsh and toxic wasteland air, as they traverse the land. They have come to the city in search of a truck, rumored to still exist in the heart of the city and the only way to traverse the desert safely. At the start of the game, the scavenger has only a rusty pipe to defend themselves and traverses mostly by walking and jumping around. As the game progresses, the character will eventually gain access to a greater range of weaponry and movement, being able to double jump and dash across the wasteland as well as shoot a gun.

## Game World

The overworld is split into two primary locations: the arid wasteland in level one and the desolate ruins of the city in level two. Taking inspiration from the Fallout series and other sci-fi and post-apocalyptic media, the world feels rather empty and unpredictable, dangers lurking at every corner.

Littered with tall cliffs, rusted spike traps, and wild mutant creatures, the wasteland holds true to its name. The remains of the city reach all the way out in the wastes too, evidenced by the rusted pipes that populate the area, which drip the radioactive goop that fill bright green pools. The wasteland is pretty sparsely populated by humans, who have largely disappeared from the Earth minus the small groups of survivors and scavengers that traverse the land. Some of these survivors have taken to collecting and trading their wares wherever they go, and one could expect to find the occassional shop near abandoned cities and ruins.

A far cry from its pre-fallout appearance, the city is now mostly rubble and ruins of destroyed buildings and cracked streets. Nowadays, as a result of a scattered human population, the city has become infested with mutant creatures, migrating in from the harsh wasteland. The dark and winding paths through the city have become hotbeds for mutant attacks, leading travelers to avoid the city as much as they can. Nonetheless, the surplus of resources left behind in abandoned supermarkets and apartment homes also make the city a treasure trove, if only one is brave enough to face the life-threatening dangers that lurk within.


## Game Experience

Pyrite Ruins is a 2D side-scrolling platformer and Metroidvania, broken up into two distinct levels, with character progression based primarily in the acquisition of various power-ups and abilities to clear and overcome obstacles.

### Level 1
The player must navigate through the vast and wild expanses of the Wasteland, initially strapped with only a rusty pipe.
- Traverse harsh terrain, including rusted pipes, pools of acidic/radioactive goop, and high cliffs.  

- Fight off wild and ravenous mutant hounds.
  
- Collect coins to exchange at the wayward shop for better weapons and boosts at the start of level 2.

    - Shop will contain upgrades for both weapons, designed to be able to afford one upon first reaching the shop, can come back with enough for the second later.

- Player must unlock various abilities and power-ups to progress.

### Level 2
The player character has now reached the remnants of the destroyed city, and must face the growing threat waiting at its center.

- Final boss is located at the end of the level and must be defeated to beat the game. Boss has multiple attacks, forcing player to quickly switch between weapons and use various abilities to take it down.  

- Cityscape is less open, requiring expert maneuvering to make it across obstacles and enemies. 

- Lesser enemies become more frequent until the player reaches the boss.

## Game Mechanics

Pyrite Ruins is played in a third-person scrolling view centered on the 2D player character. The player character must run, jump, bash, and shoot their way across the game world. Players can use a variety of basic movements, such as run and jump, but will also gain access to two advanced movements as the game progresses: double jump and dash.

### Movement Mechanics

#### Double Jump

After acquiring the double jump power-up, player characters will be able to jump once more in the air after their regular jump.

#### Dash

After acquiring the dash power-up, player characters will be able to dash for a short amount of time while moving. This move is most useful when paired with the jump and double jump features, creating the dash jump, which allows the player to dash across the screen mid-jump.

### Weapon Mechanics

Beyond these basic and advanced movements, players will also use various weapons throughout the game, which are broken down into either melee type or ranged type.

#### Melee

The player begins with a rusted metal pipe. With a short attack range and slower attack speed (compared to the ranged weapon), the melee weapon makes up for its weaknesses with a decisively higher attack power. Best used in short-range and against enemies too strong/fast to take out with just the ranged attack. Better melee weapons become available as the player progresses.

#### Ranged

The player acquires a pistol early on in level one, unlocking the ranged attack. As their name suggests, ranged weapons have increased range, allowing the player to attack from a considerable distance away. However, as a trade-off, early ranged weapons are weaker in comparison to melee weapon attacks. It is best used against armored enemies, allowing the player to damage enemies that are otherwise impervious to short-range melee attacks. Better ranged weapons become available as the player progresses.

### Currency Mechanics

To acquire weapons upgrades as well as various boosts to health, the character must collect coins, the main currency of the Wasteland. These tokens can then be exchanged at the traveling shop that sells weapons and med packs to roaming explorers such as the player character.

### Health Mechanics

The player characterâ€™s health, located in the corner of the screen and indicated by a number of hearts, lowers when damaged by enemies and obstacles and does not replenish on its own. Should the player character run out of health, the player character dies and the game is restarted from the start of the level. Health can be replenished at the occasional barrelfire.

## Enemies

The wasteland is a generally empty and desolate place, not fit for most lifeforms. However, as a result of mutations spurred on by the leaks of radioactive waste, living radioactive slime have come to inhabit the abandoned wastes. While generally not hostile and slow in their movements, these creatures can harm a player if they get too close. 

The city have become overrun by mutated hounds, rabid and dangerous creatures that chase after anything that moves. After years of radiation exposure, their fur has mutated into sharp quills, which they use to hunt other animals and the occassional human. They are fiercely territorial, chasing after anything that steps into their space. A particularly large pack of these hounds have taken over the nearby city. As the player progresses to level 2, the amount of enemies they will face will increase as they delve deeper into the hounds' territory. 
At the end of the level 2, the player will face off against the pack leader, a large mutated hound with multiple heads and a towering height. The leader is heartier and fiercer, posing a serious threat to the player as they near the end of their quest.
